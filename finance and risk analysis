##Business Case
####In the recent past, the industry of wealth management has seen a lot of growth. Every individual or business actively searches for opportunities to get the maximum returns. However, in most of the cases,
they either lack the skills to identify the right investment opportunity, or there is a shortage of time for finding these opportunities. Hence, this gave rise to the dedicated individuals who perform this task on 
behalf of the investors for a commission - Portfolio managers.

 

#####A portfolio manager makes investment decisions and carries out other related activities on behalf of vested investors. They work with a team of analysts and researchers, and their main objective is to realise
the needs of the investor and suggest a suitable portfolio that meets all the expectations. They are responsible for establishing the best investment strategy, selecting appropriate investments along with the right 
allocation. However, in doing so, they face a lot of competition in the form of other portfolio managers and rival firms. Therefore, the portfolio manager has to use the available resources to provide the best 
solution to the investor.
Following points summarise the expected tasks in the assignment:

You must use the elements of technical analysis to understand the trend of the underlying stocks. The metrics associated with risk and returns must help you realise whether the security meets the criteria of your investorâ€™s financial goals.
You must use the metrics and the visualisations to compare the performance of the available securities against each other, and also against the market index, S&P500.
The findings should be aligned with the investor persona to select the appropriate stocks for the portfolio.
After the selection of stocks, the portfolio must be validated using the active investment strategy to estimate the prices in future. You must check if the portfolio has the potential to fulfil the financial goals set by the investor.
